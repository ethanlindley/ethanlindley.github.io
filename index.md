# [ethanlindley.github.io](https://github.com/ethanlindley)

Self-taught programmer with a passion for technology. I like socket programming, networking, client-server systems and anything in-between. My preferred languages _(in order from most comfortable to least comfortable developing with)_ are as follows: Python 3.x.x, node.js, Java, C# .NET

## Notable projects

### `tlopo-launcher`

[A simple game launcher for _The Legend of Pirates Online,_ a private server recreation of Disney's now-defunct MMORPG, _Pirates of the Caribbean Online_](https://github.com/ethanlindley/tlopo-launcher)

### `datagram-python`

[`datagram-python`](https://github.com/ethanlindley/datagram-python) is an implementation of the `Datagram` and `DatagramIterator` classes from the [Panda3D game engine](https://panda3d.org), written in Python 2.7.14.

### `ByteArray.py`

Originally authored by [Zaseth](https://github.com/Zaseth), [`ByteArray.py`](https://github.com/ethanlindley/ByteArray.py) is a simple script providing methods for reading and writing binary data types in Python 2.7.14 (which is basically the same as the `datagram-python` project).

### `alarm-clock`

A simple script written in Python 2.7.14 that plays 16 bit PCM WAV audio files at a provided time -- functions as a primitive [alarm clock](https://github.com/ethanlindley/alarm-clock). Although, yes, it is a relatively simple program (and one of my earlier projects), it helped guide me into learning how to read/write binary data types.
